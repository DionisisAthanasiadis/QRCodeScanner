The app features Login and Register activities for user authentication via Firebase. It includes a scanning tool to view locations and explore maps using OpenStreetMap. Compatible with Android versions Jellyfish and up, the app also serves as an alternative GPS if a car’s GPS fails, helping users navigate back to familiar places.
